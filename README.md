Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================================

Purpose 
-----------------

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set as described below;
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis; and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called ``CodeBook.md``. 


Files
-----------------

`run_analysis.R` performs the following:

1. Merges training and test datasets
2. Extracts mean and standard deviation from each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`Codebook.md` contains the relevant description of the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
